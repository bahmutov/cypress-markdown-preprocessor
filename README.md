> Use Markdown files as Cypress specs

Read [Write Cypress Markdown Preprocessor](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/write-cypress-preprocessor/)

## Install

Assuming Cypress is a dev dependency

```
npm i -D cypress-markdown-preprocessor
# or
yarn add -D cypress-markdown-preprocessor
```

### Configure the plugin

If you are using Cypress v10+, add to your Cypress plugins file

```js
// cypress.config.js
const { defineConfig } = require('cypress')
const mdPreprocessor = require('cypress-markdown-preprocessor')

module.exports = defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      on('file:preprocessor', mdPreprocessor)
      return config
    },
    // use Markdown file from folder "docs" as tests
    specPattern: 'docs/**/*.md',
  },
})
```

If you are using Cypress before version 10, add the following to your plugins file:

```js
// cypress/plugins/index.js
const mdPreprocessor = require('cypress-markdown-preprocessor')
module.exports = (on, config) => {
  on('file:preprocessor', mdPreprocessor)
}
```

And set the [`testFiles`](https://on.cypress.io/configuration) in file `cypress.json` to use Markdown files as specs

```json
{
  "testFiles": "*.md"
}
```

## Use

Write Markdown spec files including "fiddle" comments. Each fiddle comment will be extracted into own test.

    <!-- fiddle Example -->
    ```html
    <div id="hello">Hello</div>
    ```

    ```js
    cy.contains('#hello', 'Hello')
    ```
    <!-- fiddle.end -->

The "html" block is optional.

![Example test](images/example.png)

Note: after extracting the tests, this preprocessor sets [@bahmutov/cypress-fiddle](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-fiddle) to run them.

### Multiple JavaScript blocks

You can include multiple JS blocks in each fiddle

    <!-- fiddle Example -->
    ```js
    cy.contains('#hello', 'Hello')
    ```

    Some time later more test code

    ```js
    cy.wait(2000)
    ```

    <!-- fiddle.end -->

### Multiple HTML blocks

You can include multiple HTML blocks in each fiddle

    <!-- fiddle Multiple HTML code blocks -->

    ```html
    <div id="greeting">Hello</div>
    ```

    Another HTML code block

    ```html
    <div id="name">World</div>
    ```

    ```js
    cy.get('div#greeting').should('have.text', 'Hello')
    cy.get('div#name').should('have.text', 'World')
    ```

    <!-- fiddle-end -->

### Hide HTML code block

You can hide the HTML code block from the source view, yet still have it part of the live app by adding "hide" meta after the `html`

    <!-- fiddle Hide HTML code block -->

    ```html hide
    <div id="greeting">Hello</div>
    ```

    ```js
    cy.get('div#greeting').should('have.text', 'Hello')
    ```

    <!-- fiddle-end -->

### Hide JavaScript code block

You can run but hide parts of the JavaScript code

    <!-- fiddle Hide the first JS block -->

    ```html
    <div id="greeting">Hello</div>
    ```

    ```js hide
    // the test code will run but not shown to the user
    cy.log('this block is hidden')
    ```

    ```js
    // this code will be shown to the user
    cy.get('div#greeting').should('have.text', 'Hello')
    ```

    <!-- fiddle-end -->

### CSS block

You can add CSS to be applied to the HTML application. The CSS block is not shown on the output page.

    <!-- fiddle CSS Code block -->
    ```html
    <div id="greeting">Hello</div>
    ```
    ```css
    #greeting {
    color: #f0f;
    padding: 1rem;
    font-weight: bold;
    }
    ```
    ```js
    cy.get('div#greeting')
    .should('have.text', 'Hello')
    .and('have.css', 'color', 'rgb(255, 0, 255)')
    ```
    <!-- fiddle-end -->

### Suites

To create suites of tests, use `/` to separate the suite name from the test name. Tests with the same suite name are grouped together automatically.

    <!-- fiddle TodoMVC / loads -->
    ```js
    cy.visit('/')
    ```
    <!-- fiddle-end -->

    then some time later

    <!-- fiddle TodoMVC / adds items -->
    ```js
    cy.visit('/')
    cy.get('.new-todo').type('write tests{enter}')
    ```
    <!-- fiddle-end -->

### Skipping JavaScript blocks

You can skip JS blocks in the fiddle by using `js skip` syntax

````
    ```js skip
    // this JavaScript block won't be included in fiddle
    ```
````

## Exporting JS specs from Markdown fiddles

```shell
# saves path/to/md.js file
npx export-fiddle <path/to/md>
# adds optional "beforeEach" hook with cy.visit(url)
npx export-fiddle <path/to/md> --before-each <url>
# adds optional "before" hook with cy.visit(url)
npx export-fiddle <path/to/md> --before <url>
```

## Find fiddles

You can find fiddles in Markdown files using a blog pattern

```
# find fiddles in file A.md
$ npx collect-fiddles cypress/e2e/A.md
# print found fiddles in two files
$ npx collect-fiddles --print cypress/e2e/A.md cypress/e2e/B.md
# save found fiddles into a JSON file
$ npx collect-fiddles --filename out.json 'cypress/e2e/**/*.md'
```

Note: for created timestamp, it gets the Git created date to avoid depending on the file write timestamps

```
git log --diff-filter=A --follow --format=%aD -1 -- <filename>
```

**Important:** check out all commits to get accurate timestamps. For example, if using [actions/checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout)

```yml
- name: Check out source code ðŸ›Ž
  uses: actions/checkout@v3
  with:
    # check out all commits to get accurate created date
    fetch-depth: 0
```
